# Electrical conductivity of the world ocean and marine sediments

This repo provides electrical conductivity and conductance grids for the ocean and marine sediments at 0.1 deg resolution. These models were presented in this work (accepted [manuscript](Manuscript.pdf) can also be found in this repository)

### TODO

- Provide simple interface to query the higher resolution grids
- Replace linear interpolation with a curve fit at T > 80 C
